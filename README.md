# KevCazWebsite

This is the first website I built with Jekyll. I am no longer using it, I
however let the code on the repo to keep records.

Here is the link to the repo where the code source of my current website is:
[kevcazHugoWebsite](https://github.com/KevCaz/kevcazHugoWebsite).


## How to use Jekyll

1. `jekyll serve` to work on the website    
2. then you must publish the content of the `_site` folder

NB: I did some cleaning in this *kind of deprecated* repository, nevertheless
there are issues with the layout in this version. As I have rebuilt my website
with Hugo, I did not add the motivation to fix this one.
